IConv
=====

Specific blocks dependent on the `_MSVC` macro have been defined thanks to Youngho's patches described [here](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/302012/How-to-Build-libiconv-with-Microsoft-Visual-Studio).

The rest of the library has pre-built `config.h` headers from test build systems (CentOS 5, MSYS2, and various cross-compilers).
